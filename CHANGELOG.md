Changelog
=========

august 4, 2013 - version 1.1
----------------------------

- Updated `Mobile_Detect.php` from version `2.6.3` to `2.6.6`:
  - New detection rules.
  - Fix for float number comparison.
  - Changes to code style.
- Updated `browscap.ini` from version `5019` to `5020`. This is a first update since March, but it seems that the project is finally getting back on its feet, so I'm counting on more updates pretty soon.
- "WSCommand" bot was misidentified as a user. Added an exception.
