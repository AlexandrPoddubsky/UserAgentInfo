Changelog
=========

### version 1.1 - august 4, 2013

- Updated Mobile_Detect.php from version 2.6.3 to 2.6.6:
  - New detection rules.
  - Fix for float number comparison.
  - Changes to code style.
- Updated browscap.ini from version 5019 to 5020. This is a first update since March, but it seems that the project is finally getting back on track, so I'm counting on more updates pretty soon.
- "WSCommand" bot was misidentified as a user. Added an exception.
